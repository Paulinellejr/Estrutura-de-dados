## Introduction

The study of data structures is fundamental for understanding algorithms and building efficient software. This repository is a collection of implementations that serve as a reference for practice and learning.

## Implemented Structures

- **Lists**:
  - Unordered Singly Linked List
  - Ordered Singly Linked List
  - Unordered Doubly Linked List
  - Ordered Doubly Linked List
  - Dynamic Circular List
  - Static circular list

- **Trees**:
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)

- **Heaps**:
  - Max Heap
  - Fibonacci Heaps 

- **Control Structures**:
  - Stack
  
- **search algorithm**
  - Binary search
    
## How to Use

To use the algorithms in this repository, clone the repository and compile the source code files as needed. Here is an example of how to compile and run a C file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-structures.git
